** Note:
The A4Driver reads the files from the root of the directory(workspace). If the dictionary and the test file are in the assignment4 folder, you'd have to send the file path from the root.

[root/workspace]<-- Directory where A4Driver expects input files
/src
/assignment4
/[java files]

The same is true for BlackBoxTesting and WhiteBoxTesting, but if you'd wish to read from a different directory, you'd have to manually change the argument for file reader.
BlackBoxTesting and WhiteBoxTesting also assume that the dictionary file is explicitly called "A4-words.txt"
